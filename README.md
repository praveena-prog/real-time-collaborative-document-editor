Project Title: Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor

Objective:

You are required to create a web application where multiple users can collaborate and edit a document in real-time, similar to Google Docs.




Instructions & Requirements:

1. Frontend Development:

Use React.js or Vue.js.

Your frontend should be dynamic and responsive (works well on all devices).



2. Backend Development:

Use Node.js, Python (Django or Flask), or a similar backend framework.

Backend handles user requests, real-time collaboration, and manages data.



3. Database:

Use either MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store document data, user info, etc.



4. Completion Certificate:

You will receive your certificate at the end of your internship after completing the tasks.



Key Features You Might Need to Implement:

Real-time editing (using WebSockets or Socket.io).

User authentication and session handling.

Document versioning or history tracking.

Rich text editing features (can use libraries like Quill.js or Draft.js).
